## Overview

Credit Card Fraud Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying patterns that indicate whether an applicant will repay their instalments. The goal is to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers by ensuring that applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features to train the models.
4. **Model Selection and Training**: Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) on the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the trained models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
6. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model to make predictions on new data.
